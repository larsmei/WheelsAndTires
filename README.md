# WheelsAndTires

Free Modelica package providing the easily modifiable tire models.

## Library description

The free Wheels and Tires library models wheels and tires. The contained models are intended to be used in vehicle simulations where computational performance is a major concern. Semi-empirical single contact point models are well suited for this kind of applications and are therefore applied in the presented library. These models enhance physical aspects by means of empirical equations that represent measurement results covering e.g. friction and slip characteristics. All featured tire models are split into seven objects, enabling a convenient customization of all relevant properties, with the necessary communication structure tailored to the special needs. Therefore the focus of this research effort concerns itself less with modeling new tire properties, but more with an improved organization of existing knowledge. The Wheels and Tires library provides a tool to quickly build custom tire models. This is realized by a modular and expandable design system utilizing well established models. In addition, a set of ready-made models is provided to get a quick insight into the used modeling structure and to enable a direct application in vehicle models.
